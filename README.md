# Design-and-development-of-deep-learning-architecture-for-grading-of-microscopy-images
Developed a deep learning architecture for grading microscopy images using TensorFlow and Keras.
	 Implemented a SE-ResNet14 architecture for image classification, which includes SE (Squeeze-and-Excitation) blocks for improved feature recalibration.
    Trained the model using a dataset of microscopy images, achieving high accuracy on the validation set.
   Utilized image data generators for efficient data loading and augmentation during training.
	 Evaluated the model using various metrics such as accuracy, F1 score, precision, recall, and Jaccard score, showing its effectiveness in grading microscopy images.
